# Introduction (1)

Restaurants belong in a competitive industry where success is determined by a delicate balance of food quality, service, and financial judgement. To understand financial decisions restaurants need to carefully manage costs, employ strategic pricing strategies, and maximize sales. With technology continuing to grow and impact our everyday lives, it can be beneficial for non-data driven industries, such as restaurants, to involve data into their decision making. One possibility to do so is to leverage order data to enhance sale strategies and overall performance. By analyzing order histories, restaurants might be able to unravel valuable insights into customer preferences, ordering patterns, and popular menu items. Understanding customer behaviors through this data can allow restaurants to tailor their offerings, optimize menus, and strategically price items. For pizza restaurants, analyzing the correlation between pizza ingredients and sales can reveal valuable insights into customer preferences and optimize their offerings optimally. Understanding the impact of pricing alongside ingredient combinations can guide decisions on pricing strategies or seasonal promotions, ultimately boosting sales and customer satisfaction. 

The goal of this study is to estimate what types of ingredients can significantly influence pizza sales, by using artificial data for a pizza restaurant. By running a set of regression models, we attempt to estimate the values that pizza ingredients have on pizza sales.

# Data and Methodology (2-3)
The data in this study is a dataset made for Plato's Pizza, a fictitious pizza restaurant based in New Jersey. It was made publicly available by a group called Maven Analytics. It includes about a year's worth of pizza orders, where each row shows the details about the order such as date and time, number of pizzas, type of pizzas, size, quantity, price, and ingredients. We performed exploration and model building on a 30% subsample of the data. The remaining 70%, totaling {X rows} was used to generate the statistics in this report.
